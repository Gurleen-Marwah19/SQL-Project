# SQL-Project #1
<br>
This is the MAVEN MOVIES project that I completed on Maven Analytics platform. 
<br>
<br>
This project revolves around the situation where I along with one of my partner, we purchased a DVD Rental business called MAVEN MOVIES. As the new owner and in-charge of day-to-day operations, I had to analyze everything about the business- financials, product inventory, staff, customer purchase behaviours, etc. I was given the access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database (create_mavenmovies.sql is the script for database already provided by the platform) and I had to utilize SQL and work with the data provided to get all the insights of the Business operations.
<br>
<br>
"create_mavenmovies.sql" file created the Schema/Database that contained 19 tables with all the information about the stores, inventory, films and the actors etc.
Following are the 19 tables:
1. actor
2. actor_award
3. address
4. advisor
5. category
6. city
7. country
8. customer
9. film
10. film_actor
11. film_category
12. film_text
13. inventory
14. investor
15. language
16. payment
17. rental
18. staff
19. store
