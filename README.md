# SQL-Project 3 1
<br>
This is the MAVEN MOVIES project that I completed on Maven Analytics. 
<br>
This project revolves around the situation where I along with one of my partner, we purchased a DVD Rental business called MAVEN MOVIES. As the new owner and in charge of day-to-day operations, I had to learn everything about the business- product inventory, staff, customer purchase behaviours, etc. I was given the access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database (create_mavenmovies.sql is the script for database already provided by the platform) and I had to analyze everything on my own.
